Problem statement:

Task 9: The Goldbach's problem.
The Goldbach's problem is one of the oldest problems in mathematics that has not been solved so far. In 1742, the Prussian mathematician 
Christian Goldbach sent a letter to Leonhard Euler, in which it was suggested that any even number greater than two could be represented 
as the sum of two primes. Recall that a prime number is a natural number greater than one, having exactly two natural divisors: one and
itself. To date, this statement has neither been proven nor refuted, although as of March 2004 it is known that it holds for all even 
numbers not exceeding 2*10^17. 

You need to represent a given even number N,
greater than two, as the sum of two primes a1 and a2. In this case, a1 should be the minimum possible number, and a1 ≤ a2.
The format of the input data (file.txt): The input file contains the value of the number N (4 ≤ N ≤ 10^5)
Output data format (answer.txt): The output file contains a string of two numbers a1 and a2 separated by one or more spaces.
